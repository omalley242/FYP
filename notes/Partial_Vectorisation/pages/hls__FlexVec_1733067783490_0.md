- strongly connected component(SCC) are deemed not vectorizable unless SCCs can be eliminated using techniques such as scalar expansion or privatization.

- We show that FlexVec vectorization technique produces a Geomean speedup of 9% for the 11 SPEC 2006 benchmarks studied, and a Geomean speedup of 11% for 7 real applications.

- Superword Level Parallelism (SLP) vectorization [23] proposed to transform available Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) in loops to vector parallelism when loop-level parallelism is scarce due to cyclic control and data dependencies

- Another approach to parallelize irregular loops is based on the inspector/executor paradigm [34] where the compiler generates inspector code that at runtime analyzes the crossiteration dependencies in the loop.

- Efforts similar to [29] have been successful in parallelizing graph based algorithms when loops are rewritten using their framework’s internal abstraction layers and set iterators.

- . A traditional vectorizer would therefore try to handle any SCCs in the dependence graph using one or more of the following methods:• Idiom recognition [31] is used to identify SCCs that are recurrences supported by the vector instruction set;• Self anti-dependencies can be ignored since a vector instruction reads all sources before writing its results;• Anti-dependencies involving scalar variables can be eliminated using scalar expansion, if the scalar variable deﬁnition dominates its uses.
